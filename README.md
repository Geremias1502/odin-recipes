This project is about making an index page with some recipes. 

By the end of this project I will have shown: 
* The use of GIT for version control and GITHUB for demonstration of my projects
* Use of basic HTML components such as: 
    * Elements
    * Attributes
    * HTML basic structure (HTML Boilerplate)
