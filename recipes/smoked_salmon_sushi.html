        <li>3 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>6 sheets of nori (seaweed)</li>
        <li>200g (7 oz) smoked salmon</li>
        <li>1 cucumber (julienned)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the sushi rise</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
                <li>Combine rice and water in a pot. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low heat for 18 minutes. Let it rest for 10 minutes, covered.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt until dissolved. Gently fold this mixture into the cooked rice and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
            </ul>

        <li><strong>Prepare the sushi rolling station</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Lay a bamboo sushi mat on a flat surface and cover it with plastic wrap. Place a sheet of nori shiny side down on the mat.</li>
            </ul>

        <li><strong>Assemble the sushi rolls</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li> Wet your hands to prevent sticking, then spread a thin, even layer of rice over the nori, leaving about 1 inch at the top edge uncovered.</li>
                <li> Arrange smoked salmon, cucumber, and avocado slices in a line across the center of the rice.</li>
                <li> Using the bamboo mat, roll the sushi tightly, starting from the bottom edge. Press gently to shape the roll.</li>
            </ul>

        <li><strong> Cut the rolls</strong></li>            
            <ul>
                <li>Use a sharp knife dipped in water to cut each roll into 6-8 pieces.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
