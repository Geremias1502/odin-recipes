                    <ul>
                        <li>Clean the slices of beef, trimming excess fat if necessary, and tenderize them slightly with a meat mallet or the flat side of a knife.</li>
                    </ul>
                        <li>Prepare the egg mixture</li>

                <li>Bread the meat</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Dip each slice of beef into the egg mixture, ensuring it's well-coated.</li>
                        <li> Then coat it with breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to ensure the crumbs stick evenly.</li>

                        <li><strong>Fried</strong></li>
                            Heat enough oil in a frying pan to submerge the slices. Fry each milanesa until golden brown on both sides. Drain on paper towels.
                    </ul>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Baked</strong></li>
                            Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F). Arrange the breaded beef slices on a lightly oiled baking tray or lined with parchment paper. Drizzle a little oil on top and bake for about 20 minutes, flipping them halfway through.
                    </ul>
